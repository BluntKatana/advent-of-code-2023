# Advent Of Code 2023

Learning GO and C++ by doing the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) 2023. I will see how far I can get!

---

### How to run (GO)

For the GO solutions, you can run various days and parts by running `go run main.go` in the root dir with different flags:

```
-all
    Run all days
-day int
    Day to run (between 1 and 31) (default -1)
-part int
    Part to run (1 or 2) (default -1)
-test
    Run day in test mode (input.txt -> test.txt)
```

---

### How to run (C++)

For the C++ solutions, you can run each day individually by going into the day folder and running the `.cpp` file with `g++`:

```bash
g++ day1.cpp -o output.out && ./output.out
```

### Progress

I am trying to do both GO and C++ solutions for each day, but I might not have time to do both for each day, or do them on the same day. I will try to keep the table below updated with my progress.

| Day | Title                                                                  |  Go   |  C++  |
