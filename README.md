# Advent Of Code 2023

Learning GO and C++ by doing the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) 2023. I will see how far I can get!

## How to run (GO)

For the GO solutions, you can run various days and parts by running `go run main.go` in the root dir with different flags:

```
-all
    Run all days
-day int
    Day to run (between 1 and 25) (default -1)
-part int
    Part to run (1 or 2) (default -1)
-test
    Run day in test mode (input.txt -> test.txt)
```

## How to run (C++)

For the C++ solutions, you can run each day individually by going into the `day-<num>/cpp` folder and running the `.cpp` file with `g++`:

```bash
g++ day1.cpp -o output.out && ./output.out
```

## Progress

I am trying to do both GO and C++ solutions for each day, but I might not have time to do both for each day, or do them on the same day. I will try to keep the table below updated with my progress. A ⭐️ represents a fully completed part without any help, ✨ means a part with some idea help (no code) from reddit. In addition, 🌟 means that the implementation could use some performance improvements.

| Day | Title                                                                  |   Go    |   C++   |
